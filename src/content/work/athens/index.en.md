Embedded in the community's fabric, they've demonstrated an unwavering commitment to sustainability, servicing over 250,000 customers in upwards of 40 cities.

## Challenge 

The primary challenge was to enhance user experience and streamline billing management through the development and integration of a new website. Additionally, a solution was needed to optimize internal processes and ensure operational continuity without compromising service quality. All of this needed to be achieved while maintaining the company's commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction.

## Solution

The team launched a project to revamp Athens Services' online presence and streamline billing processes. The website redesign focused on user experience enhancements, including improved navigation and a refreshed visual design that aligns with the company's environmental commitment. Concurrently, the "Pay My Bill" app was developed to allow customers easy and efficient access to their billing information across web and mobile platforms.

Crucial to these advancements was integrating these tools with the Soft-PakÂ® ERP system, known for its comprehensive support in customer service, route management, and billing. This integration ensured that the new digital enhancements worked smoothly with Athens Services' operational framework, maintaining service consistency and efficiency.

This approach was designed to boost both digital and operational efficiency at Athens Services, improving customer interaction while upholding the company's standards for environmental responsibility and high-quality service.
