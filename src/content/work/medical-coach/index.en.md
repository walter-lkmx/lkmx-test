## Challenge

Medical Coach sought to integrate pharmaceutical sales with remote medical consultations for a pharmacy. The challenge was to develop a secure telehealth platform that would facilitate these consultations and integrate seamlessly with an existing Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. This integration was essential for maintaining organized and accessible patient information for medical professionals.

A key aspect of the solution was the seamless integration with the EMR system. This ensured that all patient records were automatically updated during and after consultations, providing healthcare professionals with immediate access to patient histories and facilitating accurate diagnosis and treatment.
