## Challenge

A collaborative venture between the Culinary Art School and the Ministry of Tourism of Baja California, was developed to offer tourists an immersive guide through the state's rich culinary landscape and cultural heritage. The project needed to deliver an application that could introduce tourists to the diverse offerings of Baja California, combining historical context, culinary insights, and points of interest into a single, navigable platform. Compiling bilingual content that could cater to both English and Spanish-speaking visitors presented a significant undertaking, especially in ensuring the app could enhance the overall visitor experience and potentially boost tourism and economic benefits for the region.

## Solution

In response, a comprehensive and intuitive app was launched, featuring an intuitive design that allows users to discover Baja California's gastronomy and culture. Implementing augmented reality, the app transformed gastronomic tours by utilizing the smartphone's camera and GPS to provide a dynamic, interactive user experience. Alongside AR, it includes features like check-ins for personalized content about cuisine and locations, enhancing the tourism experience and fostering economic growth. The use of AR technology allowed tourists to engage with their environment in real-time, offering an enriched journey through the state's culinary delights and cultural sights. This integration of advanced features created a rich, user-friendly platform that stands out as an innovative resource for visitors.
