## Background

Las Cañadas Campsite and Aquatic Park sprawls across 200 hectares of natural beauty, nestled in the heart of Baja California, Mexico.

## Challenge

Efficiently managing thousands of visitors while communicating dynamic pricing and integrating revenue from e-commerce and walk-in sales posed complex hurdles. Thousands of visitors meant thousands of interactions. The twist? Our offerings varied based on the calendar—seasonal events, special promotions, and dynamic pricing. Communicating these implications to users was crucial. Revenue streams flowed from two sources: online e-commerce sales and conventional ticket purchases at the park entrance. Bridging these worlds—digitally acquired tickets and walk-in visitors—was like connecting parallel universes. We needed a unified system to track it all. Beyond the thrill of water slides and ziplines, Las Cañadas craved data. How many visitors were on-site? Where did they come from? What were the revenue trends? Strategic decisions hinged on real-time insights. 

## Solution

We didn't just build software; we crafted an ecosystem. 

* E-Commerce Platform. Our e-commerce site became a gateway to adventure. Visitors effortlessly explored water slides, wave pools, and ziplines. Clear communication about dynamic pricing—whether it's seasonal events or special promotions—ensured transparency.
