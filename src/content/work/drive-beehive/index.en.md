## Background

The issue of distracted driving, exacerbated by the widespread use of cell phones, became a significant concern on Long Island, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to enhance road safety. Observing the dangers firsthand and driven by personal stakes in community safety, a group of entrepreneurs sought to address this growing problem through technological intervention.

## Challenge

The core challenge was devising an effective method to discourage cell phone use while drivingâ€”a behavior prevalent among drivers across various age groups. The solution required turning the source of distraction into a catalyst for promoting safer driving practices.

## Solution

The development of Drive Beehive, a mobile application, stemmed from a discussion among the entrepreneurs about leveraging technology to combat distracted driving. BeeHive utilized a hybrid development approach, integrating Cordova and AngularJS on the frontend with a Java-based robust backend.

The application incentivizes safe driving by rewarding users for not engaging with their phones during trips. It pairs drivers with sponsors, such as family members or friends, who commit to providing rewards for achieving certain non-distracted driving milestones. Utilizing GPS and accelerometer sensors to detect driving activity, the app ensures that the phone remains untouched to accumulate rewards, fostering a culture of responsible driving behavior.

## Impact

Drive Beehive quickly made its mark, achieving significant traction with hundreds of downloads and support from organizations like People Against Distracted Driving and Fathers against Distracted Drivers. The app's unique approach to reducing distracted driving not only built a community of conscientious drivers and sponsors but also opened avenues for partnerships with retailers to facilitate direct reward mechanisms. The overwhelmingly positive feedback, primarily through word-of-mouth, underscored the app's effectiveness and potential for growth.
