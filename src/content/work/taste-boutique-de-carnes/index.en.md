## Challenge

The primary challenge for Taste Boutique de Carnes, a distinguished catering service in Hermosillo, revolved around establishing an online platform that could not only highlight their exceptional meat products but also offer a personalized shopping experience. They needed an innovative e-commerce solution that would allow customers to customize catering packages while accurately reflecting the brand's premium quality and service.

## Solution

The project kicked off with a discovery phase, employing a Design Sprint methodology inspired by Google, to thoroughly understand the client's requirements and ideate a bespoke e-commerce solution. This collaborative approach facilitated the creation of software architecture and application maps, ensuring a solid foundation for the platform. Over three intensive days, the team and client worked closely to design and prototype a user-centric e-commerce platform, equipped with specialized tools for customers to build personalized meat packages. The process not only catered to the client's immediate implementation needs but also outlined a strategic roadmap for future enhancements. This meticulous approach underscored our commitment to delivering tailored solutions that resonate with our clients' unique business models and objectives.
