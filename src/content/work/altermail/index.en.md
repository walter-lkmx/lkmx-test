## Challenge

During the 2019 peak of crypto, entrepreneurs around the world reimagined everything using the new capabilities given by the blockchain technology. ALTER, a company based in Estonia, was ready to place their bet in the market with Altermail: an alternative version of the traditional IM and email services, backed by a the privacy-first blockchain Secret Network.

## Solution

Altermail involved designing an unprecedented, blockchain-based platform for secure communication integrating advanced encryption with blockchain technology, to ensure total confidentiality for users' messages and data. Our solution combined our battle-tested technology stack of Java, Spring, and MySQL with JavaScript SDKs such as Griptape.js to connect with the blockchain and a basic Smart Contract for Cosmos deployed in Secret Network .

This initial artifact proved the viability of using blockchain for communication, attracting attention from privacy-conscious users and sparking discussions on the technology's broader applications. In tackling this challenge, ALTER emerged, offering a secure, blockchain-enhanced alternative to conventional communication services.
