## Challenge

In a marvelous space nestled in the Guadalupe Valley, where guests enjoy the beautiful landscape and are the center of attention, there was a need to provide a smoother and more convenient lodging experience. The Guadalupe Valley produces 90% of Mexican wine and has over 80 wineries and more than 40 restaurants around. With so many attractions, guests expected a hassle-free check-in and room access process to maximize their time and fully enjoy their stay.

## Solution

To address this challenge, a mobile application was developed that revolutionized the process of reserving and accessing rooms. With just a click, guests could book their stay and receive a digital access key. This key allowed them to enter their room directly through a smart lock, without needing to go through the reception desk.

The application offered a seamlessly integrated experience, from reservation to check-out. Guests could independently occupy and vacate their rooms using the app-controlled smart lock. This provided them with convenience and flexibility during their stay while reducing congestion at the reception.


In addition to the room access functionality, the application also provided detailed information about the establishment and its surroundings, including recommendations for local wineries and restaurants. This additional feature enhanced the overall guest experience, allowing them to make the most of their visit to the Guadalupe Valley.
