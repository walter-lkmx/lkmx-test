## Challenge

Vitromex, a company specializing in sustainable premium ceramic floor tiles for retail and large architectural projects, faced significant challenges with their previous systems' inability to integrate effectively with their accounting platform. This integration issue hindered their operational efficiency, especially in managing quotes, orders, sales, and material deliveries. They needed a system that could not only handle their internal workflow but also synchronize seamlessly with external catalogs and financial records.

## Solution

To address Vitromex's integration challenges, a system was built to enhance operational efficiency by managing workflows from quotes to deliveries and ensuring seamless synchronization with their accounting platform and external catalogs. Developed with Java, Spring for backend operations, and AngularJS for a responsive interface, the system utilized RESTful APIs for robust third-party integrations. MongoDB supported dynamic data storage needs. Deployed on the Google Cloud Platform with Docker and Kubernetes, it offered a scalable solution, while Cloudflare ensured security. This streamlined approach significantly improved Vitromex's ability to manage its processes and maintain customer satisfaction.
