    content: "The success of an amusement park and campsite like Las Ca単adas largely depends on its ability to attract and manage visitors efficiently. For this reason, it was necessary to develop an easy-to-use e-commerce system that presents the park's wide range of activities and services in an attractive and accessible manner."

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>There were a number of challenges that needed to be addressed to achieve a satisfactory experience. The main challenge was finding a way to efficiently manage the acquisition of visits and other activities in the park. To achieve this, a good user experience design was needed in the e-commerce, as the products offered had different configurations based on the calendar. The ability to clearly and efficiently communicate to the user the implications and conditions of their purchase was essential.</p>   
    <p>Another challenge was the integration of the revenue recorded in the e-commerce with the conventional park access flows, where customers can purchase tickets directly at the entrance to the facilities. To address this complexity, a comprehensive admission system was required that combined both sources of income, and also a control and analysis tool that allowed the organization to monitor and optimize the operation of the park in its entirety.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To address the aforementioned challenges, three complementary systems were developed that worked together to provide a satisfactory user experience and an efficient park management:</p>   
</div>
<ul class="story_story__mainContent__fullList__ClxE5">
    <li>Ecommerce
        <ul>
            <span>An intuitive and easy-to-use e-commerce system was designed, with the ability to show the park's offerings in a clear and efficient manner to the user. Additionally, the different product configurations based on the calendar were integrated, and clear and efficient communication of the implications and conditions of purchase was allowed.</span>
