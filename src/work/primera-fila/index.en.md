## Background

PrimeraFila was envisioned as a transformative online platform dedicated to simplifying the process of purchasing live event tickets. With the digital era reshaping consumer expectations for convenience and efficiency, PrimeraFila sought to deliver a seamless ticket buying experience from selection to event access. This ambition led to the conceptualization of a multifunctional system that integrates an E-commerce platform for ticket sales, an Access App for event entry, and a Console for comprehensive event management.

## Challenge

The endeavor presented a complex set of challenges. The project required the creation of a user-friendly yet robust E-commerce platform capable of handling multiple transactions simultaneously without compromising system stability. Furthermore, it necessitated the development of an Access App that could swiftly verify tickets at venues and a Console that empowered administrators with extensive event, user, and financial management tools. Adding to the complexity was the need for a virtual queue mechanism to ensure the E-commerce platform remained stable during peak traffic times.

## Solution

Addressing these challenges, a cohesive development strategy was implemented, which involved crafting a secure and stable E-commerce platform that allows for easy event searches, seat selection, and seamless transactions, either online or through alternative payments. User accounts were introduced to simplify future purchases. An Access App was developed to expedite ticket scanning and validation at venues, enhancing the entry process. The Administrative Console was designed to give organizers control over event setup, user management, ticket sales, venue mapping, and the customization of venue layouts through a specialized venue editor. This editor enables precise placement and categorization of seats within various zones, streamlining the event planning process. Additionally, a mobile app extension for iOS and Android mirrored the E-commerce platform's capabilities, including a virtual queue feature to maintain system stability. A purchase history module was integrated across the website and mobile app, providing users with a convenient way to view transaction records and access QR codes for paperless event entry.
