## Challenge

The primary challenge for Suspiros Pastelerías, Mexico's largest bakery with a nationwide presence, was to develop their first e-commerce platform. This platform needed to not only reflect their broad selection of products but also accommodate the unique pricing and product availability across various franchises and cities. Given the franchise model, each location had different offerings and pricing, requiring a highly customized solution to provide a seamless and personalized shopping experience for customers based on their specific city.

## Solution

A custom e-commerce system was developed, tailored to meet Suspiros Pastelerías' specific requirements. This innovative platform featured a location-based pricing and product availability system, allowing it to dynamically adjust the product listings and prices according to the customer's city. By integrating this level of customization, Suspiros could offer a personalized shopping experience, ensuring customers in different cities saw only the products available in their area, with accurate pricing reflective of each franchise's policies.
