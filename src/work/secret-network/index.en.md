    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of the main challenges faced by the Secret Network blockchain was the lack of a centralized place where all the information and valuable content generated by the community could be accessed. Documentation, blog articles and other types of content were scattered across different sites, making it difficult to consult and access information by users.</p>
    <p>Additionally, our client required a platform where articles and content generated by the community could be efficiently managed and published. That's why it was necessary to develop a new website that met these requirements and provided a unified experience for users.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To address these challenges, the solution implemented for the Secret Network blockchain was the creation of a new website with an integrated experience for the community. With the aim of unifying the information scattered across different sites, Vue.js and Gridsome were used as a Jamstack framework to build the website.</p>

    <p>The Jamstack paradigm is a way of building modern web applications that combine the use of JavaScript, APIs and Markup. Instead of having a traditional backend that serves dynamic pages, Jamstack applications consist of static components that are served directly from a CDN server, and dynamic components that are managed by APIs, thus improving the security, speed and scalability of the platform.</p>
    <p>Under this paradigm, we integrated a headless CMS, Strapi, which allowed the Secret Network team to have complete control of the site's content, including detailed configurations for SEO optimization. This project was also a milestone for us, as we implemented for the first time our design system called Flare. This system allowed us to build the UI of the website faster and more efficiently, achieving perfect results for any type of device.</p>
