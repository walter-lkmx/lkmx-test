## Challenge

The government of Baja California initiated the Outstanding Host Baja program to spotlight and promote tourism establishments within the state that meet SECTURE's quality standards. The primary challenge was creating a robust website to serve as an authoritative directory for these endorsed locations, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the tourism database of the State's Secretary of Tourism. The platform required a design that was not only user-friendly but also capable of providing tourists with dependable information, thereby enhancing trust and certainty in the quality of tourism services offered in Baja California.

## Solution

Our role encompassed the comprehensive design and development of the website, including a detailed directory for the Baja California government's Outstanding Host Baja program. In collaboration with Eraboy Studio, who provided the graphic art for the homepage, we introduced interactive animations to enrich the user experience. This concerted effort resulted in a navigable and informative platform that efficiently connects tourists with establishments distinguished by the program for their superior hospitality and quality, solidifying Baja California's appeal as a reliable and attractive tourist destination.
