### Background

Chimpers is an innovative NFT project featuring a vibrant collection of unique characters, each brought to life through captivating art, compelling storytelling, epic games, and immersive adventures. With a global community of superfans, Chimpers strives to entertain, inspire, and bring joy to people around the world. The project sought to redesign its website to modernize its appearance and enhance the user experience, making it easier to manage content and interact with its community.

### Challenge

The project faced several challenges. The client's team was distributed across London, South Korea, and India, necessitating the management of significant time zone differences. Additionally, there was a need to integrate APIs for subscriptions and NFT information retrieval. Adapting a detailed and specific design to various devices and resolutions posed another challenge. Lastly, incorporating interactive elements and sounds without compromising the user experience was essential.

### Solution

Logic Kernel adopted a structured approach to address these challenges. The team adjusted the design and conducted backlog grooming sessions to refine specific requirements. Strapi was integrated as the CMS, enabling the client to manage characters, events, news, and other key elements of the website. The project was developed over six sprints with continuous releases to receive regular feedback from the client. Rules were implemented to ensure that the design looked good on different devices and resolutions. Additionally, interactive features such as an interactive map and embedded games were developed to enhance user engagement.
