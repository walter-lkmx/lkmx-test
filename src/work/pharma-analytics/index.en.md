    content: "Our client, a prominent pharmaceutical company operating in Mexico, Colombia, and Central America, encountered challenges in handling its vast data requirements. The process involved manually collecting, cleansing, and processing data from various sources, resulting in time-consuming report generation through Excel spreadsheets for stakeholders. This method not only delayed decision-making but also increased the risk of data inaccuracies. The company recognized the need for an advanced solution to streamline its data management, reduce manual intervention, and enhance the accuracy and accessibility of insights for strategic decision-making across its operations."

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge stemmed from navigating regulatory restrictions in Mexico that prohibit pharmaceutical companies from directly promoting medicines to the public. This necessitated a strategic shift in marketing efforts towards direct outreach to prescribers, while concurrently gathering sales and distribution data from various channels to identify patterns and opportunities throughout the year. However, the complexity arose from the disparate nature of these channel datasets, which were extensive, lacked interrelation, and exhibited varying dimensions.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>First, we had a discovery with a few dozen regional directors and district managers which allowed us to get to know the differentÂ information sources involved and the needs of each of the areas in regards to them. After this, we designed a work plan with multiple phases for the implementation of a solution. </p>
    <p>We engineered a comprehensive platform capable of ingesting data from over 25 disparate sources provided by different vendors. This platform implemented a robust data cleansing, enrichment, organization, and preparation mechanism, leveraging advanced design patterns and Apache Spark technology to construct optimized indices spanning lengthy time periods on-demand. These optimized indices formed the foundation for more than 20 dashboards and over 100 charts and visualizations, empowering decision-makers to enhance the efficiency of their sales force through informed insights derived from unified and enriched data sources.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>By streamlining data processing and reporting, the company experienced improved operational efficiency and agility in decision-making processes. The ability to ingest and analyze data from multiple different sources enabled the identification of valuable insights and trends, empowering marketing departments to target prescribers more effectively and optimize sales and distribution strategies. Moreover, the enhanced data visualization capabilities provided by the dashboards and visualizations facilitated clearer communication and alignment across the organization, ultimately driving improvements in sales force efficiency and performance. Overall, our solution catalyzed a positive transformation in the company's data management practices, fostering better strategic decision-making and driving business growth.</p>
