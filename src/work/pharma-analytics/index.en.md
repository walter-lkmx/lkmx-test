    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Our client faced a hard task in handling its data. The manual collection of information was a time-consuming and error-prone process, which in turn made it difficult to obtain accurate and updated information. Moreover, the collected information was stored in multiple reports shared in Excel, making the processing and purification of data an even more complicated task.</p>
    <p>The lack of an overall vision of the company affected not only daily decision-making but also long-term planning. A solution was needed that would break the repetitive cycle of acquiring, processing, and analyzing information, which prevented it from advancing in its ability to make decisions and plan for its future effectively.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>To tackle the data handling challenges, we started by executing our Discovery service with the involvement of regional directors and district managers. This process allowed us to thoroughly understand the different sources of information and the specific needs of each company area. With this information, we developed a work plan in multiple phases for the implementation of a tailor-made solution.</p>
    <p>We designed a graphical interface for bulk data loading, which includes custom validation and purification algorithms. The platform efficiently processes years of information in hours, generating optimized indices and dozens of customized reports that can be accessed in real-time.</p>
    <div class="story_story__mainContent__2cGrid__aNFn8">
        <div>
            <p>The solution implements the 5 key stages of data analysis, with technologies specifically selected for each phase. The collection phase includes the use of Java APIs to catalogue and transfer the information to a robust mechanism based on Apache Spark. This process purifies and organizes the complete information using Google Cloud's Data Proc and Big Query services. Finally, Elastic Search indices are generated and accessed through a hybrid web interface based on Vue JS and Kibana.</p>

    <p>Kibana is a key component in our solution and an added value for the end-user. With this data visualization and analysis tool, the user can efficiently interact with the information, generating customized graphs and dashboards that are updated in real-time. This provides a complete and detailed view of the information, which helps the user make precise and up-to-date decisions, even without prior experience in data analysis.</p>
