## Background

In the intersection of fashion and technology, SKYOU emerged as a beacon for creative minds. By offering an advanced on-demand clothing production platform, it empowered artists, brands, and entrepreneurs to effortlessly bring their unique apparel ideas to life. With its innovative 3D design tool and a network of international factories, SKYOU made custom fashion accessible, bypassing the traditional hurdles of bulk orders and simplifying the journey from concept to consumer.

## Challenge

However, SKYOU's journey wasn't without obstacles. The platform's initial setup, crafted by a prior development team, struggled to meet the demands of its users, resulting in inefficiencies that affected the overall creative process. These technical challenges created a gap between the platform's potential and its operational reality, putting a strain on the team's ability to offer optimal customer support and manage workflows effectively.

## Solution

In response, we took a holistic approach to enhance the platform's functionality. A key move was the introduction of an intuitive color detection system, enabling designers to precisely match their creations with specific Pantones. This innovation assured the accuracy and vibrancy of the final products. Additionally, we revamped the image upload and catalog management system, streamlining the process to ensure a smoother user experience. Our introduction of customizable "white label" options further enabled brands to tailor the platform to their identity, offering a bespoke branding solution that enriched the user experience.
