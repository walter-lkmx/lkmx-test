    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Despite its focus on providing solutions to artists, brands, and entrepreneurs, the SKYOU platform faced challenges due to a deficient implementation by another development team. This put the desired efficiency and productivity at risk. The platform, although well-intentioned, had problems with its primary flows, which generated friction between users and the platform. This, in turn, made it difficult for the SKYOU team to provide good customer support, generating an extra workload for them.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Despite the initial challenges, thanks to a continuous effort to optimize the platform and close collaboration with our client, we have managed to transform it into an efficient and easy-to-use tool.</p>
    <p>Our team has achieved one of the most significant improvements in the SKYOU platform with the integration of a color detection system that allows the user to relate them to specific Pantones. This feature not only guarantees the quality of the final printed product, but it also increases the accuracy and consistency of the colors used in the designs, which is essential to achieve a professional and attractive presentation of the products. Furthermore, this improvement has allowed users to have greater control over the final appearance of their products, which contributes to their success and satisfaction in using the platform.</p>

    <p>We optimized the image upload and catalog management flows, allowing for more efficient organization and a more comfortable user experience. Previously, users faced difficulties organizing their files and maintaining a clear connection between them. Now, there is a dedicated space for each of them, and SKYOU staff can access the same files that the customer sees, ensuring clear direction and organization.</p>

    <p>As part of our effort, we have made SKYOU a highly versatile system, even visually. The "skin change" or "white label" feature is a demonstration of the adaptability we offer, allowing brands to integrate their image into the platform and use it under their own name. This development reflects our commitment to offering a unique and innovative experience to all of our customers.</p>
