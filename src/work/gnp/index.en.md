## Challenge

GNP, headquartered in Mexico City, stands as one of the premier insurance providers in the nation. The company was confronted with the need to enhance its service offerings for business partners by streamlining the process of generating corporate quotes. This task involved orchestrating hundreds of calls, a requirement that demanded high efficiency and reliability to maintain GNP's standard of service.

## Solution

In response to this challenge, a specialized API was developed to manage the complex network of calls necessary for creating corporate quotes. This project was a collaborative effort between our top engineering team and GNP's IT department, focusing on the architecture, design, and implementation of critical back-end components. These components were engineered to meet stringent Service Level Agreements (SLAs), processing requests within microseconds.

The development of this API utilized Java, incorporating JPA and Spring for robust back-end functionality and supporting both REST and SOAP clients to ensure compatibility and flexibility in communications. The deployment infrastructure leveraged Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes, hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, to provide a scalable and resilient environment. Cloudflare was integrated for enhanced security and performance.

This technological approach enabled GNP to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of generating corporate quotes for their business partners, reinforcing the company's position as a leading insurance provider in Mexico.
