    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>In the implementation of this solution, we faced several significant challenges. One of the biggest challenges was that it was necessary to integrate the platform with the existing information systems of our client. The complexity of the integration required a careful and methodical approach to ensure the correct transfer of data and interaction between the systems.</p>
    <p>Developing a system that impacts a country's health system is a task of great responsibility. For this reason, it was essential that the implemented solution was highly resilient and secure, ensuring the proper functioning and traceability of the medications sent to hospitals across the country. This challenge was approached with the utmost diligence and attention, ensuring a successful implementation.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The solution we implemented for the client was an application with a microservices-based architecture that combines patterns and cloud technology to ensure high resilience and security. To achieve this, we used robust technologies such as Java, Elasticsearch, and Spring Boot, which allowed the client to adapt the platform to their specific needs without compromising quality and security.</p>
    <p>We precisely orchestrated the different key processes that were crucial to the success of the mission, such as taking and approving orders, validating inventories, and notifying the appropriate actors in the supply chain. All this, without forgetting the importance of the traceability of the hundreds and thousands of medications that are sent across the country every month.</p>
    <p>We faced the challenge of ensuring that all stages of the process, from the taking of the order to the final delivery, were recorded and controlled. To achieve this, we developed specific applications for different actors in the supply chain, such as supervisors, carriers, agents, and pharmacy employees.</p>

<div>
    <p>The combination of these efforts allowed our client to have a complete and real-time visibility of the medication supply chain, which not only improved their efficiency but also allowed them to optimize the tracking and control of their shipments, ensuring the timely and accurate delivery of medications to national recipients.</p>
