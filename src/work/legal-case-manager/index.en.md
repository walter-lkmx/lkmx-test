    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of the main concerns was ensuring the security and privacy of patient data. For this reason, we had to implement security measures that comply with the standards established by HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). This included the encryption of sensitive data and the implementation of authentication and authorization measures to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to the information.</p>
    <p>In addition to complying with HIPAA standards, it was also necessary to define and develop tools used by lawyers and healthcare providers for legal case management and to allow for better visibility and tracking of cases, as well as communication tools such as email and instant messaging to facilitate communication among team members. These features were essential to provide an optimal experience for the platform's users.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>A legal process can be complex, requiring a practical and efficient solution at each step. With this in mind, these challenges were addressed by dividing the project into three stages:</p>
</div>
<div>
    <span class="story_story__mainContent__phasesSpan___jSDV">First stage</span>
    <p>A Discovery project was carried out to understand the scope and limitations of the project and avoid unnecessary requirements work.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <span class="story_story__mainContent__phasesSpan___jSDV">Second stage</span>
    <p>A responsive application was developed that can be used on any device, which avoids long and consecutive updates. The execution of our Agile Development service allowed us to be flexible and adapt to changes in project requirements.</p>
    <p>The platform has several tools to improve efficiency and collaboration in the legal process. One of the integrations is Twilio, which allows sending text messages through the platform, which improves the efficiency of some of the system's functions.</p>

        <div>    
            <p>Another important integration is Google Maps, which allows users to easily find the location of healthcare providers and lawyers they will work with. In addition, we have integrated Pixel and Google Tag Manager to improve tracking and analysis of website visits.</p>

        <div class="story_story__mainContent__2cGrid__article__CIxE2">
            <p>Among the various integrations of this project, Elasticsearch has been key in simplifying the search and navigation on the platform for users.</p>

    </div>
    <div>    
        <p>The LegalStream platform is a Software as a Service (SAAS) system, so we have also integrated Stripe to ensure a secure payment process and comply with financial compliance standards.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have also integrated Elasticsearch to improve search and navigation on the platform, which allows users to find information quickly and easily.</p>
