## Challenge

Farmacias Vida, a specialty pharmaceutical company in Mexico, faced the challenge of expanding its e-commerce platform to better serve customers accessing their services from mobile devices. With over 2,000 products managed through a custom ERP system, the company required a solution that could seamlessly integrate with its existing infrastructure and provide a comprehensive mobile shopping experience.

## Solution

A hybrid mobile application was developed, encapsulating the company's e-commerce web platform. This application was designed to offer a consistent and user-friendly shopping experience across various devices. The solution involved integration with the company's custom ERP system for efficient data management and product display.

This approach allowed Farmacias Vida to extend its digital presence into the mobile space effectively, providing customers with a versatile platform to access their extensive product catalog, thus enhancing customer engagement and accessibility.
