## Introduction

We were approached by an auction wine house that was looking to improve its online presence by developing a mobile app for its auctions. The wine house had a successful track record of hosting 
online auctions on its website, but it recognized the potential for growth by providing a dedicated mobile app for its users. The previous mobile app that they had was poorly designed, and slow, and provided a poor user experience, leading to low adoption rates. The project's goal was to create an  
app that would allow users to browse and bid on wines from their phones and to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges that we faced on this project was the need to integrate with the wine house's existing database of auction inventory and display the information in real time with a fast response. This database contained detailed information about each wine, including its vintage, region, and tasting notes, as well as its current bidding status. It was essential that the app access and display this information quickly and efficiently to provide a seamless user experience.

Another challenge that we had to address was the need to handle confidential data securely through the app. The wine house handled high-value items, so it was essential that we implement robust security measures to protect against fraud and ensure the confidentiality of user information.

*The main catalog of current bids displays a list of all the wines being auctioned, with information such as the wine's name, vintage, and current bid price.*

## Solutions

To address these challenges, we developed a custom app that utilized a RESTful API to integrate with the wine house's inventory database seamlessly. This allowed us to quickly and efficiently display real-time information about each wine, including its current bidding status, to app users. We also implemented a number of security measures to protect the confidentiality of user data, including encryption of sensitive information and strict access controls.

*The user saved bids feature allows users to save and track their favorite wines.*

The users are able to:

- Create a watch list of wines that they were interested in.
- Contact the seller directly via e-mail.
- Submit bits at a later time.
- Participate un auctions.

The project was developed using our AGILE DEVELOPMENT service, and we delivered value to the customer on each sprint. This allowed us to be flexible and responsive to the changing needs of the wine house and ensured that we were able to deliver a high-quality product that met their needs.

As with all of our projects, this project began with a discovery phase in which we worked closely with the wine house to understand their needs and objectives. This phase involved a detailed analysis of their existing online auction process, as well as the user experience of their previous mobile app and current bids website. Based on this analysis, we were able to define the scope of the project and determine the best approach for developing the new mobile app. The discovery phase was critical to the success of the project, as it allowed us to establish a solid foundation and ensure that we were able to deliver a product that met the needs of the wine house and its users.

*The Gantt chart for this project shows the discovery, AGILE development, and testing and deployment phases. The discovery phase involved understanding the client's needs and analyzing their existing process. The development phase involved delivering value on each sprint to be flexible and responsive. The testing and deployment phase involved thorough testing and deployment of the app with support.*

## Conclusion

The app we developed will continue to help the wine house improve its online presence and provide a much better user experience for its customers than its previous app. It delivers a seamless and secure platform for conducting auctions, increasing trust and confidence in the wine house's online auctions. Our team is proud to have played a role in the success of this project and looks forward to continuing to work with the wine house in the future.
