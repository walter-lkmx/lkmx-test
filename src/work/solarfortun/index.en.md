## Challenge

Solar Fortún needed to boost its online visibility to match its recognition as a premier winery in Baja California. With an array of wines and notable vineyard experiences, the winery required a digital platform that facilitated effortless wine purchases and vineyard visit reservations. The task involved creating a website that would not only display the winery's extensive offerings but also ensure a user-friendly experience for customers wishing to explore and engage with Solar Fortún's diverse products and experiences.
