## Background

La Casa Hogar del Anciano de Ensenada A.C., established in 1954, has been a sanctuary for the elderly in Ensenada, offering care and protection with compassion and dedication. The home caters to individuals over 81 years old, many of whom require specialized attention due to their physical conditions. Despite the commitment to improving their residents' quality of life, the institution encountered a crisis that threatened its very existence.

## Challenge

The advent of the pandemic brought unforeseen challenges for La Casa Hogar del Anciano. Critical funding cuts, the halting of fundraising events, and the urgent medical needs of the residents placed the home in a state of emergency. With the possibility of closure looming, there was an immediate need for an effective communication campaign to facilitate direct donations and garner support to keep the doors open for its elderly residents.

## Solution

To address the critical financial shortfall, our team initiated and crafted a streamlined website as a pro bono endeavor for La Casa Hogar del Anciano de Ensenada A.C. The site was meticulously designed to synthesize key information, providing easy access for donors to learn about the home's mission and the urgent needs of its residents. With intuitive design and clear pathways for contribution, the website was an unexpected gift to the institution, catalyzing the collection of essential funds and rallying community support in a time of unforeseen crisis.
