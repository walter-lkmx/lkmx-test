## Background

We got one of our biggest challenges when a Hollywood star called us and asked us to build their e-commerce and data analytics platform in just four weeks, adding up to the fact that it was going to last only 72 hours when released to his more than 30M followers at the moment. No room for failure allowed.

Faced with the ambitious goal of launching an exclusive e-commerce platform for Will Smith's first merchandise brand: The Fresh Prince, our team was challenged to create a system that could withstand the high traffic of eager fans within a tight deadline.

## Challenge

Our design team had one of their biggest challenges to-date when they had to design a pixel-perfect Shopify theme and storefront working along with world-class brand and product developers in Los Angeles.

In parallel we had to conceptualize, architect, design and build a scalable platform capable of managing heavy traffic and real-time transactions, all while integrating comprehensive sales and social media data analytics with a beautiful look and feel so Will Smith himself could monitor the sale during the exclusive 72 hours.

## Solution

We started the development right away using Kanban to speed up the velocity between task conception and deployment dividing the work among two teams: one in charge of the storefront development and a second one in charge or developing the data analytics tools.

The first team built a Shopify theme using Liquid from scratch to be able to satisfy the very specific requirements that the client had over what was going to be his very first e-commerce marketplace. We were able to achieve a clean, minimalistic look that focused on the product and a simple user experience that allowed us to capture the data required to present into a custom dashboard.

The second team built a custom back-end system capable of handling the anticipated traffic volume and providing real-time data insights. 

## Impact

The launch of the exclusive e-commerce platform for The Fresh Prince brand was a great success. It handled the surge of interest from over 30 million followers, offering a smooth shopping experience during the critical 72-hour window. The platform not only withstood the heavy traffic but also executed transactions flawlessly, showcasing the robustness of the infrastructure. The integration of sales and social media analytics provided a comprehensive view of customer interactions, enabling data-driven decisions that were crucial in managing the high demand. The clean, user-focused design of the Shopify storefront, combined with the efficient backend system, ensured that fans had an enjoyable and smooth experience, contributing significantly to the brand's successful market debut.
