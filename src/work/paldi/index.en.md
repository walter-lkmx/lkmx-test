## Challenge

Paldi, a retailer operating across the US/Mexico border, specializing in blinds, curtains, tents, and floor tiles, faced operational inefficiencies due to their reliance on Excel files for managing orders. This method was inadequate for handling their growing volume of orders, affecting their ability to efficiently process quotes to confirmed orders and accurately calculate commissions and incentives.

## Solution

A comprehensive Order Management System was developed to transform Paldi's operational capabilities. This system streamlined the management of high volumes of orders, from initial quotes to confirmed orders, and introduced custom reporting features. These features enabled decision-makers to effectively monitor operations and automate the calculation of commissions and incentives. A significant update allowed the system to serve both the Mexican and US branches of the company, enhancing cross-border operational cohesion.
