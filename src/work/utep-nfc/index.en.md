## Challenge

The primary challenge was developing a data collection prototype for a significant transportation company in Mexico City and its metropolitan area. The goal was to create a reliable system for validating passenger access on employee and school transportation services. With employees utilizing access cards for their designated transport, there was a critical need for a seamless verification process that connected to a central database, ensuring accurate passenger tracking and report generation.

## Solution

To meet this need, a sophisticated Android application was developed, leveraging NFC technology for instant scanning of transport access cards within the vehicles. This app communicated with a central database, confirming passenger authorization in real time and generating detailed reports on passenger activity. This innovative approach significantly enhanced the management of the transportation service by ensuring operational efficiency and security. Through this project, a significant step was taken in applying technology to improve the logistics of corporate and educational transportation services.
